          TOUCHOS
       IMA TOUCH YOU
================================

This is obiously still in development, However, TouchOs will be an operating system and kernal that I am making with the focus on large touch screen x86_64 based systems.
If you want the best experiance, then install on a Dell Inspiron 13 7370, without the screen, keyboard, trackpad and housing, with an Acer T230H touchscreen monitor.
The Kernal, Drivers, Window manager and Graphics stack will be made by me. The system will support .deb packages, although I am unsure of how well they will run. Right now I only have the bootloader.


Thank you to the Nyarch discord, because people there like me (for some reason) and helped me with recources.
Feel free to use anything in this repo for your own work, just as long as it is lawfull (and credit is not neccisarry, but is liked)
This Operating System/Kernal should not be used as a daily driver, support will be very limited as I am only working on this as a small hobby, and with my ADHD-fuckass brain, this will probaly loose support soonish.
Thank you for taking the time to read this. Stay Sexy. ~Nya :3
