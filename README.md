# üñêÔ∏è TouchOS

> *"I'm going to touch you"*

Welcome to **TouchOS** - the operating system that finally answers the age-old question: "Am I gay?"

Yes.

## Project Status: Bootloader My Beloved ‚ù§Ô∏è

We have successfully achieved the following milestone:
- ‚úÖ The computer is a real, physical object,
- ‚úÖ The bootloader may be done. (untested)

Coming soon‚Ñ¢:
- ‚ùå Literally everything else

## What Even Is This?

TouchOS is an ambitious (questionable) journey to build a complete operating system from scratch that runs on real x86_64 hardware. Why? Why Not!

### The Vision‚Ñ¢

- **Kernel**: Because who needs Linux when you can write your own scheduler at 3 AM?
- **Custom Drivers**: USB support written by someone who Googled "how does USB work"
- **Graphics Stack**: Pixels will appear on screen (probably)
- **Window Manager**: Touch-friendly UI that assumes you have fingers
- **On-screen Keyboard**: For when you inevitably break your physical keyboard from frustration
- **Debian Package Support**: `.deb` files because we're fancy like that

### Target Hardware

- **Conputer Devobe**: Dell Inspiron 13 7370, No keyboard, No trackpad, No screen, No battery and No chassis. (just like how god intended)
- **Display**: Acer T230H touchscreen (the chosen one)

## Current Features

1. **Bootloader** - It boots! Sometimes. Probably. 
   **Half Built Kernal** - It might Not work

## How to Build
**BUILDING THE SYSTEM DOES NOT EXIST YET! I AM STILL WORKING ON THE KERNEL, AND I WILL MAKE AN INSTALLABLE .IMG AT SOMR POINT!**
```bash
# Step 1: Question your life choices
# Step 2: Install dependencies (TBD)
# Step 3: There is no step 3 yet
# Step 4: Profit?
```

## Documentation

Documentation will be written once I figure out what I'm actually doing. Current documentation consists of:
- Scattered comments in the bootloader

## Contributing

Want to contribute? Here's what I need:
- Emotional support

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project is:
- Not production ready (it's not even "turn it on without supervision" ready)
- Probably reinventing several wheels
- A learning experience in pain tolerance
- Definitely not going to replace the got-teir distros nike Nyarch anytime soon
- Absolutely not responsible for any hardware damage, data loss, or existential crises

## License
I cannot drive.

TBD - probably something that says "use at your own risk and don't blame me when it deletes your homework"

## Why Though?

Because. Idk? I can

Also because:
- I hate myself
- I hate myself
- I wanted to truly understand what "segmentation fault" means
- Touch interfaces need more love
- Why not?

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

- [x] Bootloader that might boot, might not.
- [ ] Kernel that kernels
- [ ] Memory management (malloc or die)
- [ ] USB driver (pray for us)
- [ ] Graphics that aren't VGA text mode
- [ ] Window manager with big, touchable buttons
- [ ] Virtual keyboard (smash those on-screen keys)
- [ ] Package manager that handles .deb files
- [ ] World domination (stretch goal)

## Contact

Found a bug? That's probably a feature.
Want to help? I need therapy.
Have questions? So do I.
